/// individual commands in a command-line interface (CLI) application.

/// including instantiation, CLI argument definition, and execution logic.

    /// ```rust
    /// let cmd = MyCommand::new();
    /// ```
    fn new() -> Self;

    /// Defines and returns the CLI structure of the command.
    ///
    /// This is where the command name, arguments, subcommands, and help message
    /// should be configured using a CLI argument parser (commonly `clap::Command`).

    /// A `Command` definition used by the CLI application to register this command.

    /// - `path`: The working directory or base path relevant to the command execution.
